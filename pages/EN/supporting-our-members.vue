            Throughout the last year, the Member Relations team have served as
            the first point of contact for Members and regional groups via a
            four-person team, each focused and expert on a given region.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            In addition to working closely with Members to defend their
            interests with governments and regulators, the team engaged in
            regular dialogue with Directors General and International Relations
            to stay across member priorities and partnered with colleagues
            across the EBU on initiatives that included the new ‘A Day With’
            deep dive into leadership at NRK, YLE, RTBF and RUV as well as
            strategy-setting sessions at BNR, GPB and TRM.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            We also continued our work on accountability to Members, further
            improving data presented in individual annual Member activity
            reports that serve as a platform for discussion with Members on
            enhancing engagement as well as internally.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            Solidarity, that is core to the EBU’s DNA and practiced across the
            organization, is also channeled via the Member Relations Partnership
            Programme, an earmarked reserve designed to serve Members in need.
            Initiatives include a meeting of CTOs from the Arab region at the
            2022 Technical Assembly, the second summit of Directors General of
            CEE Members held together with the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung and an
            initiative to support Member projects in six CEE countries. We’ve
            also devoted particular attention to our Ukrainian Member, UA:PBC,
            to support them since the Russian invasion, including funding of
            Starlink terminals and facilitating inclusion at EBU events.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            Member Relations also completed the second phase of the four-year
            EU-funded Programme for Technical assistance in the West Balkans
            that has helped transform the work of PSM in Albania, Bosnia
            Hercegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia.
            Milestones of this programme included principles on governance to
            protect PSM independence and funding to ensure financial autonomy
            and accountability and a new archive platform for content exchange.

            We measure satisfaction on an annual basis with the Member
            satisfaction survey. The results of the 2022 survey showed
            increasing overall satisfaction with the EBU, up from 83% in 2021 to
            89% and from 40% in the first survey of this type, carried out in
            2019. This important exercise also generates valuable information on
            Member expectations that shapes our strategy and corporate goals
            going forward.
