            This has been an extraordinary year for the EBU and I’m incredibly
            proud of the work of all our staff in these testing times.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            We are living through unprecedented times in the media industry.
            And, simultaneously, we’re experiencing unprecedented times in media
            regulation, as regulation - and we - try to catch up!
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            The European Media Freedom Act is hugely significant for the
            European media sector. The team has been working tirelessly across
            our Geneva and Brussels offices to ensure the best possible outcome
            for public service media. We’ve been organizing high-level events,
            keeping close to the decision makers, and also created a video
            toolkit explaining how big tech tampers with media content. The
            debates continue and we will keep pushing!
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            Meanwhile, on platform regulation, the Digital Services and Digital
            Markets Acts have now been finalized and we’re now helping Members
            to understand how they will apply with practical workshops and
            guidebooks.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            At the same time, we’ve started an intense and very public campaign
            to keep the lower UHF spectrum.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            To support all these important streams, we’ve grown our
            communications and events work in Brussels to keep PSM in the
            headlines with events ranging from screenings of the latest European
            content to discussions on journalist safety.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            Altogether we have represented PSM on 20 speaking platforms on
            topics ranging from media freedom to the technical implementation of
            the Digital Markets Act. We’ve also published 13 policy positions,
            including joint statements with other stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            At the same time we’ve participated in critical debates at the
            national level, like funding, remit, governance, state aid and new
            national media laws.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5 lg:pb-7 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            These are exciting but also critical times for media regulation in
            Europe. I’m really proud of what the team has and will achieve. We
            invite all Members to get involved because only with their input and
            support can we secure the best future for PSM in Europe.
